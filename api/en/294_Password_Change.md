# Change Password(\_\_mypassword)

## Overview

An API that performs operations on the account's password

### Change password of own account

Change password of your account.  
\* The Account update API can also change the password of the Account, but this requires the auth authority of the cell level ACL and uses it for management purposes.  
\* Because of changes to the account, CellLocalToken by account authentication is mandatory, not UnitUserToken.  
\* If the account status is "passwordChangeRequired", it will be updated to "active".
