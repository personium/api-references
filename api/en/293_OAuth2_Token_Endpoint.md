# OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint

## Overview

An API endpoint that issues access tokens to access various APIs in the cell. It complies with the OAuth 2.0 specification, it authenticates users and applications in various ways and issues tokens such as access / refresh tokens.

### Variation of user authentication

#### Account holder authentication with password

* Resource Owner Password Credential (ROPC) flow in OAuth 2.0.
* Based on the registered account name and password, you can authenticate the owner of the account and receive access token issuance.
* As a defense against brute force attack, even if the password is legitimate for that account for one second after failure of authentication, an authentication error will result.
* This flow should be used only by cell administration applications such as Cell GUI, which cell owners place high levels of trust.
* As described in the OAuth 2.0 specification, general Personium applications should not use this flow.

#### Authentication of other cell user by transcell access token

* The authentication method corresponding to the SAML 2 assertion flow of the OAuth 2.0 extension.
* You can issue an access token by authenticating another cell user by sending a transcell access token addressed to this cell.
* Re-authentication of the application is required here even if application authentication has been undergone when issuing a transcell access token to be transmitted.

#### Continuation of user authentication by refresh token transmission

* By sending a refresh token, it is possible to receive a new access token that inherited the user authentication state received when the refresh token was issued.
* Re-authentication of the application is required here even if application authentication has been undergone when issuing a refresh token to be transmitted.
* Applications cannot be switched at token refresh by sending client_id different from the originally used one when the refresh token is issued.
* Use OpenID Connect ID tokens in cases that authenticated state should be transferred form one app to another, such as single-sign-on from a cell application to a general application.
* Access tokens or refresh tokens should not be shared or exchanged among applications.

### Information transmission for application authentication

* Personium uses OAuth's client authentication framework to authenticate the application.
* Personium uses the schema URI of the application as client_id. In many cases the schema URI is the URL of the applet.
* Personium uses an application authentication token as client_secret.
* Information transmission for application authentication is not mandatory.

### Variation of issue token specification

#### Issuing an access token

If there is no parameter specified as p_target, it will issue a valid access token (cell local access token) in this cell.

#### Issuing a Transcell Access Token

By specifying the URL of another cell by using the parameter called p_target, we issue a Transcell access token for accessing other cells
### Other variations

#### Issuing cookies

* If p_cookie is specified as a true value, cookies that are valid only in this cell are issued.
* This cookie alone does not substitute for the access token, but by using it together with the character string "cookie_peer" issued at the same time, it has the same effect as the access token.
* When you get a resource on this cell, access this URL by adding this value with a query parameter called cookie_peer to the URL so that it handles the same as access token transmission only when correspondence with cookies sent at the same time is obtained.
* With this, it is possible to display private media only to authorized users using tags such as HTML img video audio.
* Cookies that are issued are valid only in this cell and can not be used in combination with p_target, which is a token acquisition parameter for accessing other cells.

### Record of authentication history

In case of password authentication (when "password" is set at the time of request as grant_type), the last authentication date and number of authentication failure are recorded as authentication history.<br>
An account that does not record authentication history can be set in [Target cell property setting](./291_Cell_Change_Property.md).

Target cell property setting  
```xml
<p:accountsnotrecordingauthhistory>{Account name(can specify multiple items separated by commas)}</p:accountsnotrecordingauthhistory>
```
